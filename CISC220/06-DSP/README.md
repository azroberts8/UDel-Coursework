## Basic Setup

For this project we have prepared a Makefile that that uses GCC to compile for *NIX systems. Make sure you have GCC installed on your system before proceeding with these steps!

To compile and run the program use:
```bash
make run
```

To only compile the program without running use:
```bash
make all
```

To remove the compiled output:
```bash
make clean
```
